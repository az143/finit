# System hotplug handled by udev, mdevd, or mdev (preferred order)
#
# Your system usually has either udevd, mdev, or mdevd.  They probe the system
# for devices, loading modules and any firmware needed.  Since the bootstrap
# often needs to be synchronized carefully, we suggest using your system log
# daemon as the barrier for all other services.  E.g.:
#
#    service if:udevd <run/udevadm:5/success> [S0123456789] syslogd -F -- System log daemon
#    service if:mdev  <run/coldplug/success>  [S0123456789] syslogd -F -- System log daemon
#    service if:mdevd <run/coldplug/success>  [S0123456789] syslogd -F -- System log daemon
#
# This provdes a <pid/syslogd> condition that can act as a barrier for all
# other services.  Notice the `if:` statement and the condition for starting
# syslogd is only considered if either udevd or mdev (service) is loaded and
# is guaranteed to run after each respective run stanza have completed.
#
# Override this file by copying it to /etc/finit.d/, using the same name, then
# change the contents any way you like, it can even be empty.

# Check for systemd-udevd and eudev, if we find both, we opt for the latter.

# If udevd is not available, check for mdevd.  Unlike plain 'mdev -df', the
# mdevd-coldplug process exits when mdevd has completed.  So the condition
# <run/coldplug/success> (same as for plain mdev below) can be relied on as a
# barrier for services that, e.g., need to probe for switchcore ports or PHYs
# that require firmware loading before they show up.
